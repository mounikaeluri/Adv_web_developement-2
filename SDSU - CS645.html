<h2>Programming Assignment #2</h2>
<div class="centered">
    <i>100 Points</i>   
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Due Date/Time:</h3>
    <p>
    Your project is due on Thursday, March 19th 4:00 PM. Pacific Coast Time.
    </p>
    <h3>Entry Point:</h3>
    <p>
    The entry point for your project is a file called login.html.  This should go at the
    top level in your <tt>web_services/</tt> folder. Thus, your all of your pages will be deliver 
    by Tomcat, not Apache. The first page of your project (the login screen) will be 
    displayed if the user directs the browser to: <tt>http://jadran.sdsu.edu/jadrnXXX/login.html</tt>
    </p>
    <h3>Java Web Services:</h3>
    <p>
    This assignment is an introduction to Java servlets and JSP (Java Server Pages).  You may not place 
    any part of the project code in or below your public_html directory or the cgi-bin directory
    for this project. 
    [ NOTE:  you should leave all product images where they are.  The URL for product
    images should be a location in your public_html/ directory tree, and they should stay there. ]     
    You may not use anything other than Java servlets/JSP for dynamic server-side code in this assignment;  no 
    Perl or PHP etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
    For this assignment you will create a portion of an inventory application 
    for your online retail site.  This portion is an application 
    that will handle receipts of new merchandise and returns to vendor or sales of existing merchandise. 
    More generally, merchandise RECEIVED INTO INVENTORY and merchandise REMOVED FROM INVENTORY.
    The intention here is an application that warehouse staff might use the record movement
    of inventory into and out of the warehouse.
     
    The application consists of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A login screen</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;The user must supply an authorized 
        username/password pair to gain access to the system.</li>
        <li><b>Inventory Received</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;  This form should have the following
        fields:  Date, SKU, Vendor, Category, Manufacturer's Identifier, Quantity. The date 
        field should be pre-filled with today's date.  Once the user enters the SKU, all
        remaining fields except the quantity should be filled in using AJAX.  The
        record must be stored in the MySQL database on opatija.sdsu.edu.  You will need to 
        create addional tables for this.  Only the Date, SKU, and quantity fields should be editable.</li>
        <li><b>Inventory Sent Out</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;  The specifications for this form are the same 
        as for the Inventory Received form.  However, these records go into a different table.</li>
        <li><b>Confirmation</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;After submitting either an Inventory Received,
        or Inventory Sent Out form, a confirmation should be displayed in the browser.</li>
        <li><b>A logout link</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;When this link is clicked, the user is logged out.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Details:</h3> 
    <p>
    <b>The login screen</b><br />
    Present the user with two fields, the <i>username</i> and <i>password</i>. The form 
    will also have a <i>clear</i> and a <i>submit</i> button.  If the user enters a valid
    username/password, the Menu page will load.  If the login is invalid, then 
    the login screen should reappear, along with a helpful error message.
    </p>
    <p>Username/password pairs must be stored in the MySQL database on opatija.  The 
    username should be stored in plain text, and the password <b>MUST</b> be stored in an 
    encrypted form.  You may <b>not</b> use a text file on disk, nor may you hard code any
    name or password in your Java source code.
    You must have at least four valid username/password pairs, one of which <b>must</b> 
    be:
    </p>
    <pre>
        username:   cs645
        password:   sp2015
    </pre>
    <p>
    You should use POST as the parameter passing method.  Use Javascript to place the 
    cursor on the username field when the page loads.  Simple things can mean a lot for 
    useability.  The user should not have to grab the mouse and manually give focus 
    to the username field.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>The Inventory Received/Sent Out Screens</b><br />
    You must verify that the SKU entered matches a record in inventory.  You cannot receive
    merchandise not ordered by the buyer, nor can you sent out things you don't have. 
    Do not allow the form the be submitted
    if the SKU is invalid.  Make sure that the quantity field is not zero or negative.
    Be sure to use Javascript to put focus on the first field when the 
page loads.  
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Database Tables</b><br />
    You will need to create three new tables for this portion of the application.
    <ul>
    	<li><b>merchandise_in</b>  Merchandise received into the warehouse.  This 
     	    table should include <b>sku, date, quantity</b> fields.</li>
    	<li><b>merchandise_out</b>  Merchandise sent out from the warehouse.  This 
     	    table should include <b>sku, date, quantity</b> fields.</li>
    	<li><b>on_hand</b>  The on hand quantity for each item in inventory.  This 
     	    table should include <b>sku, last_date_modified, on_hand_quantity</b> fields.
	    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Submission</h3>
    As with the previous assignment, for this project, you will create a zero-byte file named 'finished' 
    in your web_services/ folder.


        <h3>Grading:</h3>
        <p>
        Your grade will be determined based on four criteria: inclusion of 
        the minimum specifications, validity of the xhtml and CSS code,  
        use of Javascript/AJAX, and quality of the Java code.
        </p>

        <h3>Cheating:</h3> 
        <p>
        Just a reminder here.  Collaboration  is not permitted for this 
        course. You are expected to complete all project assignments 
        <b>on your own</b>. 
        You must write all xhtml, css, Javascript and Perl code on your own.
        You may use JQuery or any other Javascript library if you wish.
        You may <b>not</b> use any code generation 
        tools (Dreamweaver, Frontpage etc). Collaboration with anyone , or 
        use of 
        code generation tools is considered cheating.  If you adapt or copy 
        code from the Internet, be sure to cite the source.  This should be 
        limited to specific techniques.  Any student 
        caught cheating on the projects or a midterm exam will receive an "F" in the 
        course, and a report will be filed with the University.
        </p>
